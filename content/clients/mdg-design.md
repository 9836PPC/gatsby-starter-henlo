    Promotional application for iOS had to be paired with backend application
    for optimal solution
  topcontent: >-
    MDG Design provided me with the designs for the iPad application. Within
    couple of days we had a working prototype ready to be tested by the client. 


    Application's main goal was to collect participants data for Viega
    competition. For optimal data browsing and collection I had to come up with
    a backend application for viewing, downloading and managing data from the
    application.

    ## Mobile application with Laravel backend


    After reviewing the use cases for the application, my team decided to use
    React Native for creating the mobile application and Laravel with Vue for
    quickly scaffolded backend application. 


    We prepared the app to be deployed to iPads used during the events with
    readable, clean backend panel ready for marketers to deep dive into the
    collected data.

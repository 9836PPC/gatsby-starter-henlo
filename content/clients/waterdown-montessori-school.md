    New owners wanted to update website to attract new parents to their
    educational offer
  topcontent: >-
    During the project my task was designing and writing new website for the
    school. Main goal was to create a system to generate leads from parents
    interested in school's offer. I've created a form system that easy to extend
    and modified in the future.


    Created forms allowed parents to sign up for a tour of school and get
    additional information fast. Custom theme developed for Waterdown enables
    for changes and edits without additional developer's work.


    Additional to presenting educational offer the owners wanted to implement a
    simple job board for potential teachers that will help gather most important
    information about the candidates.

I build interactive, responsive websites and web applications using cutting edge technologies. If your project requires more then 1 dev, don't worry I collaborate with other amazing devs and designers!


Everyday I work with such backend technlogies as PHP, Laravel, Node.js, ngnix and Linux servers. I'm also proficient in bulding bespoke WordPress themes. On the front end I work with Vue and React. No task is impossible with the right attitude :)
